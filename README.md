# TBPrediction
The goal of the project is to develop a Bayesian Network-based AI system and to evaluate its performance. The system should be implemented in Python using pyAgrum. It's created using an Ipython notebook, including a Bayesian Network Model and a Decision Model based therof. 

<!-- 'dropout.ipyn' file runs the initial Bayesian Network Model, and can make inferences thereof

'DNdropout.ipynb' file runs the Decision  Network Model, with chance, decision and utility nodes for our previously
defined Bayesian Network Model seen in 'dropout.ipynb'

Can run all the Jupyter code blocks using run all button at the top of VSCode -->
