# Fraud prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a Bayesian Network-based AI system and to evaluate its performance. The system is implemented in Python using pyAgrum. It's created using an Ipython notebook, denoting a Bayesian Network Model and a Decision Model. 

# Evaluation of Model

It is evaluated by use of different scenarios whereby we either set no evidence, set intuitive evidence that should logically make the decision obvious (thus testing our Decision Network Model if it can make the correct decision based on the levels of Utility) aswell as a scenario with ambiguous evidence.
