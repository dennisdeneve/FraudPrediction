# TB Prediction
The goal of the project is to develop a Bayesian Network-based AI system and to evaluate its performance. The system should be implemented in Python using pyAgrum. It's created using an Ipython notebook, including a Bayesian Network Model and a Decision Model based therof. 

#Evaluation of Model

It isevaluated by use of different scenarios whereby we either set no evidence, set intuitive evidence that should logically make the decision obvious (thus testing our Decision Network Model if it can make the correct decision based on the levels of Utility) aswell as a scenario with ambiguous evidence.

<!-- 'dropout.ipyn' file runs the initial Bayesian Network Model, and can make inferences thereof

'DNdropout.ipynb' file runs the Decision  Network Model, with chance, decision and utility nodes for our previously
defined Bayesian Network Model seen in 'dropout.ipynb'

Can run all the Jupyter code blocks using run all button at the top of VSCode -->
